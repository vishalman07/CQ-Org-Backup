    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Preferred_First_Name__c},



Thank you so much for registering your interest to attend {!Campaign.Portal_Title__c}.

We&apos;ve been overwhelmed with expressions of interest for this event from generous volunteers just like you and  at this stage, we unfortunately don&apos;t have any places available.

However, we will keep you on the waitlist and if any volunteers are no longer able to attend, we&apos;ll be sure to notify you as soon as possible.

We hope to see you on one of our fun-filled resilience building programs soon!


Kind Regards,

{!Campaign.Campaign_Owner_Name__c}</textOnly>
