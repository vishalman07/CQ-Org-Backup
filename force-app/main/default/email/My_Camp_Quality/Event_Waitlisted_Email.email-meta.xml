    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name} ,



Thank you so much for registering your interest to attend {!Campaign.Portal_Title__c}.



We&apos;ve been overwhelmed with expressions of interest for this event and at this stage, we unfortunately don&apos;t have any places available.

However, we will keep you on the waitlist and if any families are no longer able to attend, we&apos;ll be sure to notify you as soon as possible.

We hope to see your family on one of our fun-filled resilience building programs soon.


Kind Regards,</textOnly>
