We are so excited that you made the first step in helping us level the playing field and become a volunteer for Camp Quality through our Bro Up campaign.

We are holding volunteer interviews near you soon and would love to meet you. If you are still interested in joining us, please finalise your application by clicking https://www.campquality.org.au/article/524-register-broup-2017?First_Name={!Lead.FirstName}&amp;Last_Name={!Lead.LastName}&amp;EOIID={!Lead.ExternalID__c}

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me or to check out our Become A Volunteer page. If you decide not to proceed with your application, we would love to hear from you as to why.


We look forward to hearing from you and can&apos;t wait to have you along for a camp - it&apos;s going to be an experience you&apos;ll always remember J
